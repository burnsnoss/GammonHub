  GammonHub is currently a command line backgammon game written in python. In the future, 
I want to add some kind of pretty looking web UI so that I can play online any time against 
my friend whose ass I like to kick from time to time. In the even further future from that,
the ambitious plan is to implement a backgammon AI. 

Backlog:
 - Create move validation and gameplay
 - Create player 2 game board view for command line
 - Create ability to customize pieces/names
 - Install jQueryUI
 - Create board/web classes
 - Create web game mechanisms
 - Connect python turn mechanism to web frontend
 - Host on web server
 - Create user connectivity
 - Create web customization ability
 - Create community board vs. private boards
